# Changelog

## [Released]
### Highlights
- Added repeating timer scheduling helpers plus the `TickTokHelper.timer()` accessor for "every X ticks/time do this" loops.
- Added `SubTickScheduler` utilities for fractional tick delays (half/quarter ticks or custom values) using real-time scheduling, plus server-thread helpers.
